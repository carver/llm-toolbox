# Design decisions

Settled choices about how the tools behave, each with its reason and the evidence
for it, and the alternatives that were tried or measured and dropped. Read a tool's
entries before changing how it behaves. Reviving a rejected alternative needs the
owner's agreement, and new evidence.

## heavy

### One job at a time in a lane, on this VM (2026-11-08)

A second check running beside the first buys no throughput here: it only makes each
check slower, past the time limits test runners set. The VM shows 16 vCPUs, but a
full commit check runs no faster on 16 than on 8, and two checks side by side finish
no sooner than the same two one after the other.

The measurement, inside `heavy --alone`, with hyperfine. The guest is a KVM VM that
lscpu shows as 16 single-core sockets, with 15 GB of memory and no swap.
A is filedrawer's full check, `bin/agent-pre-commit` with no CHECK_BASE, after
touching `crates/server/src/lib.rs` so that it recompiles the server crate and
relinks its test binaries, as a commit does. B is llm-toolbox's whole suite,
`.githooks/agent-pre-commit` with no CHECK_BASE. Both at nice 0, each pinned with
taskset.

| Run                                 | vCPUs          | Wall time                    | User CPU |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- | -------- |
| A alone                             | 0-15, 16 jobs  | 173 s (1 run)                | 602 s    |
| A alone                             | 0-7, 8 jobs    | 166 s (2 runs, ±0.3)         | 438 s    |
| B alone                             | 8-15           | 106 s (2 runs, 90 to 122)    | 333 s    |
| A, with B back to back on 8-15      | 0-7, 8 jobs    | 425 s (2 runs, 385 to 465)   | 1324 s   |
| B, beside those two runs of A       | 8-15           | 163 s (6 runs, 109 to 215)   |          |

- The work of the shared phase, 2 runs of A and 6 of B, takes about 970 s one after
  the other (2 × 166 + 6 × 106) and took about 977 s side by side.
- The same check took three times the CPU seconds while the other half of the vCPUs
  was busy (438 against 1324 s), and A on all 16 vCPUs took 37% more than on 8. The
  vCPUs share physical cores on the host, most likely as hyperthread pairs, which the
  guest can't see.
- It isn't memory or disk: in every phase free memory held at about 200 MB with the
  rest page cache, disk reads stayed at 46 to 188 blocks a second, iowait under 1%,
  and steal under 4%.

So heavy's "% busy", which counts vCPUs, overstates the room left: a lane that looks
half busy may be using most of what the host gives this VM. The levers for faster
landings are fewer full checks per landing and cheaper ones, not more at once.

The script and its raw results (hyperfine JSON, vmstat logs) are in
`/home/carver/code/claudedev/cache/heavy-lane-exp/` on the host disk, outside git.

### Rejected: a second job on the holder's cores at nice 10 (71650a7, eadadb6, 2026-11-08)

heavy let one more job start beside a holder that left cores idle, on the same cores
at nice 10. Under contention a nice-10 process gets about a tenth of a core, so when
the holder burst onto every core, as cargo's compile and link steps do, the sharer
stalled. A commit check that shared beside a busy `cargo nextest run` took 7m47s
instead of about 1.5 minutes, and two of its tests failed on their time limits;
filedrawer's bin/tests took 826 s sharing against 70 s alone, and a wizard test timed
out. Only `heavy --share` work shares now, meant for work with no time limits, such
as a build.

### Rejected: two lanes on separate vCPUs at equal priority (2026-11-08)

Measured in the first entry: the same throughput as one lane, with each job 1.5 to
2.6 times slower.

## wt-ship and the commit checks

The owner's rule: every commit that reaches remote main passes the full check.
In sessions from 2026-11-04 to 11-08 on filedrawer, agents spent about 35 to 40 of
104 hours blocked on checks. heavy's queue usually held one to five jobs ahead, nearly
all `agent-pre-commit`, and a landing ran the full check at each commit, again in
`build-state finish` on each commit a fold rewrote, and again in wt-ship after its
rebase. wt-ship's recheck failed none of 34 logged landings, and most refusals at a
commit came from tests of the code it changed.

### wt-ship checks every commit it lands (9927dd7, 2026-11-08)

Each commit with no pass on agent-commit-gate's record, oldest first, each checked
out in turn in the worktree, then HEAD. Before, it checked only HEAD, so after a
rebase the commits before it reached main checked only on the base they were made on.

### build-state finish only folds (1465ae5, 2026-11-08)

wt-ship checks a fold's new trees when it lands them, so finish's own run of the
full check on each rewritten commit was a second one.

### A repo may run a lighter check at each commit (2d50a0e, 2026-11-08)

A repo's `agent-commit-check` runs at each commit in the full check's place, with
passes on a record of their own, so wt-ship runs the full check on each such commit
when it lands. The hook's line marks a commit's run with AGENT_CHECK_AT_COMMIT=1
rather than the gate finding `git commit` among its parents, which a check that runs
the gate's own tests under an agent's commit would fool.

### Rejected: `wt-ship --check CMD` (removed in 9927dd7)

Nothing used it. It came with wt-ship's first version, for a repo that had no
`agent-pre-commit` then and has one now.
